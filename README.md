### CMake project starter with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)

It was made to work on Windows using the MSVC compiler, but it should also work on Linux with gcc.

P/S if you are working under linux - don't forget to download raylib for linux and put it into /libs/raylib-5.5 folder. You will also need to update the compiler paths in CMakePresets.json
